## Notes from PyData 2016

### How to use


Make sure you have [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and [ipython](https://ipython.org/) installed.


```bash
#clone the repo from github
git clone https://github.com/y3l2n/pydata2016-notes

#create a virtualenv (can also use conda)
virtualenv -p python3 lib

#use the virtualenv
source ./lib/bin/activate

#install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

#start the jupyter notebook server
jupyter notebook

```
The Jupyter notebooks are split up by day with notes that we took, some with links to githubs, others with functional code examples.
